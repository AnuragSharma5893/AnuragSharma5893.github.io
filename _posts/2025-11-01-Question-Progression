# 🚀 LeetCode Learning Path — From Basics to Advanced

A curated list of **10 essential LeetCode problems** selected to help beginners gradually master programming fundamentals, data structures, and algorithms—just like we do at Meta when guiding new engineers!

---

## 🧩 Stage 1: Programming Foundations  
> *Focus:* Loops, conditionals, basic array & string manipulation

1️⃣ **[Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)**  
- Concepts: Arrays, HashMap, brute force → optimization  
- Key Idea: Transition from O(n²) to O(n)

2️⃣ **[Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)**  
- Concepts: String parsing, rule-based conditions  
- Key Idea: Efficient mapping and logical iteration

---

## ⚙️ Stage 2: Arrays & Strings  
> *Focus:* Two pointers, sliding window, frequency logic

3️⃣ **[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)**  
- Concepts: Greedy, one-pass algorithm  
- Key Idea: Track minimum and max profit dynamically

4️⃣ **[Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)**  
- Concepts: Sliding window, HashSet/HashMap  
- Key Idea: Optimize instead of brute force substring checking

---

## 🔁 Stage 3: Recursion & Backtracking  
> *Focus:* Recursive thinking, decision trees, backtracking

5️⃣ **[Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)**  
- Concepts: DFS, recursion, swapping  
- Key Idea: Understanding recursion tree generation

6️⃣ **[Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)**  
- Concepts: Power set creation, backtracking  
- Key Idea: Add/remove & explore all combinations

---

## 🌲 Stage 4: Core Data Structures  
> *Focus:* LinkedList, Stacks, Trees, BFS/DFS

7️⃣ **[Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)**  
- Concepts: Pointer manipulation  
- Key Idea: Iterative & recursive approaches

8️⃣ **[Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)**  
- Concepts: Tree traversal, Queue, BFS  
- Key Idea: Level-by-level data collection

---

## 💡 Stage 5: Advanced Problem-Solving  
> *Focus:* Dynamic Programming, Graph Exploration

9️⃣ **[House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)**  
- Concepts: Dynamic Programming  
- Key Idea: State reuse & optimal substructure

🔟 **[Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)**  
- Concepts: DFS/BFS, graph connectivity in grids  
- Key Idea: Count connected components

---

## ✅ Study Tips:
- **Always** start with a brute-force idea → optimize later
- Write and explain complexities: Time & Space
- Draw recursion stacks, arrays, and data structures
- Learn common patterns: Sliding Window, DP, BFS/DFS

---

### 🌟 Goal:
Master problem-solving fundamentals that scale into real-world engineering — the same expectation we have at Meta for strong performers.

Happy coding! 💻🔥
